# jobs and procurement

The [job and procurement board is the issue board](https://github.com/LDSSA/jobs/issues)!


## How it works: Jobs

After following the [Job Posting Approval](https://github.com/LDSSA/wiki/wiki/Job-Posting-Approval-%5BWIP%5D) process,
we can add an issue to the job board with our own custom-written description and a link to the actual job itself.

When posting a job, make sure to do the following:

- Assign the person who is willing to take responsibility for bringing the job to the community
- Add tags to express who it might be most interesting for. If we are lacking tags, let us know and we'll add them.
- In the title of the post, prefix [Job]
